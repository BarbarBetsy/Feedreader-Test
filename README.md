# Project Overview

This is a feedreader with a Jasmine test and a project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree.
The code of the feedreader was provided by Udacity. The tests are written by me.

## Dependencies

* jQuery
* Jasmine

## How to run it?

To run the feedreader you need a working internet connection (to load the feeds). Simply open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser. You can switch to a different feed by clicking on the hamburger icon in the upper left corner of the page. Click on one of the feed names to change to it.

## What it tests

Jasmine will test:
- if the feeds exist and are not empty
- if each feed has a name and URL
- if the menu is hidden my default
- if the menu will be visible/hidden again if the hamburger icon is clicked
- if the feed has at least one article in it
- if the feed changes when a new one is loaded
